Why build your own shell?
A shell is the bridge between user intent and the operating system. It interprets user input, parses commands, and coordinates processes. It decides how to connect commands through pipes, where to send input and where to capture output, and when to run tasks in the background. Building a shell is a practical way to learn:
- How processes are created with fork and replaced with programs via execve
- How file descriptors are rearranged to implement input and output redirection
- How pipes connect the standard output of one process to the standard input of another
- How the kernel schedules tasks and how signals interrupt execution
- How to design clean interfaces between a command line parser, a command executor, and a job control subsystem

This project treats these topics as a practical, hands-on exploration. You will gain a better understanding of what happens when you run a simple command and why certain features exist in modern shells. It is an excellent companion to OS lectures, textbooks, and systems programming labs.

How it works under the hood
Think of the shell as three collaborating parts:
- The parser reads a line from the user, breaks it into tokens, and builds a structured representation of the command sequence.
- The executor takes this representation and creates processes, wires up pipes, and applies redirections.
- The job control and signal subsystem monitors running processes, handles background tasks, and prepares for clean termination.

A typical interactive session follows this flow:
- The user types a command line.
- The parser validates syntax, resolves tokens, and builds a command graph.
- The executor forks processes for external commands, sets up needed pipes and redirections, and calls execve for each child.
- The shell waits for foreground jobs to finish or returns control to the user for next input while background jobs keep running.

This workflow is designed to be readable and easy to extend. Each piece has a small, clear responsibility, which makes it easier to reason about the behavior of a shell in different scenarios, such as when a pipe spans multiple processes or when a built-in needs to modify the current directory.

Getting started
Follow these steps to explore the project locally. The goal is to provide a reliable, educational environment where you can experiment with the core ideas behind Unix shells.

Prerequisites
- A POSIX-compliant environment (Linux is ideal, macOS is supported with minor differences)
- A C compiler (gcc or clang)
- Basic build tools (make is convenient, but not strictly required for a manual build)
- A shell session with access to a terminal (for interactive use)

Project goals and scope
- The shell aims to be minimal yet complete enough to demonstrate the essential OS concepts.
- It focuses on clarity over feature breadth. You can read and modify the code without chasing obscure edge cases.
- It provides a solid base for education. You can add new built-ins, experiment with additional redirection modes, or implement more advanced job control features.

What you will learn by exploring this project
- How a command line is parsed into structure that can be executed
- How a child process is created and what happens during an execve call
- How to redirect input and output to files or pipes
- How to connect multiple processes with pipes for streaming data
- How to manage foreground and background tasks, including basic job control
- How to handle signals to avoid zombie processes and clean up resources

Getting started with the repository
- Clone the repository to your local machine
  - git clone https://github.com/Destides/Build-your-own-shell.git
- Inspect the source tree to understand the organization
  - src/ contains the core logic for parsing, executing, and job control
  - include/ contains header definitions used across modules
  - examples/ contains illustrative usage scenarios and test scripts
  - tests/ contains small unit and integration tests to validate behavior
- Read the README and documentation to understand design decisions, interfaces, and usage patterns

Building from source
This project is designed to be approachable for learners and easy to build on common development setups. The build steps are straightforward, and you can adapt them if you want to experiment with alternative compilers or toolchains.

Option 1: Using a simple Makefile
- If the repository includes a Makefile, run:
  - make
- This will compile the source files and produce an executable in a standard location (for instance, build/shell or bin/shell)
- To run the shell:
  - ./bin/shell
- If the Makefile places the binary elsewhere, adjust the path accordingly.

Option 2: Manual build with a compiler
- If you prefer to compile manually, you can compile the core modules with a command like:
  - gcc -std=c11 -O2 -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -c src/parser.c -o build/parser.o
  - gcc -std=c11 -O2 -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -c src/executor.c -o build/executor.o
  - gcc -std=c11 -O2 -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -c src/builtins.c -o build/builtins.o
  - gcc -std=c11 -O2 -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -c src/main.c -o build/main.o
  - gcc -o bin/shell build/parser.o build/executor.o build/builtins.o build/main.o
- The exact commands depend on your file layout and the selected entry point. If you need to adapt, adjust include paths and dependencies accordingly.

Option 3: Using a containerized environment
- For reproducible builds, you can use a container with a POSIX environment and the necessary toolchain.
- A minimal Dockerfile might install build-essential and compile the project inside a clean image.
- This approach helps when you want to demonstrate the shell in a controlled environment or present it in a classroom setting.

Running and using the shell
Once you have built the shell, you can begin exploring its behavior in interactive mode.

Launching the shell
- Start from the terminal:
  - ./bin/shell
- You will see a prompt and be ready to type commands.

Interactive behavior
- The shell reads a line of input from the user and interprets it as a command or a pipeline.
- It supports built-in commands to manage its environment and state.
- It can spawn external processes for non-built-in commands via fork and exec.
- It handles common shell features like pipelines and redirections to demonstrate real-world usage.

Examples of typical commands
- Simple command
  - ls -l
- Piping
  - ps aux | grep bash | sort -k2
- Redirection
  - ls -l > listing.txt
  - wc -l < listing.txt
- Appending output
  - echo "Hello, shell" >> greetings.log
- Background tasks
  - sleep 5 &
  - echo "Background job started" && jobs
- Built-in commands
  - pwd
  - cd /tmp
  - exit

Important usage notes
- The shell exposes a simple yet representative set of features to illustrate the core concepts.
- It is designed to be safe in an educational setting, but you should avoid running untrusted code in any shell you build or modify.
- The command parser aims for predictable behavior. If you provide complex or ambiguous syntax, the shell will respond with a clear error and show a help message.

Built-ins and command execution
Built-in commands are implemented inside the shell so you can see how a shell manages its internal state without launching a separate process. At a minimum, you should expect:
- cd: Change the current working directory of the shell process.
- exit: Terminate the shell gracefully, ensuring all background processes are managed correctly.
- pwd: Print the current working directory.
- help: Show a short guide to available commands and options.

How the parser works
- The parser tokenizes the input line into commands, arguments, and operators.
- It recognizes pipes, redirection operators, and background execution markers.
- The parser builds a data structure that represents a sequence of commands and the connections between them (for example, a pipeline consisting of several processes).

How execution works
- For a simple external command, the shell forks a child process and calls execve with the given program and arguments.
- For pipelines, the shell creates a chain of pipes and arranges each process so that the output of one command becomes the input of the next.
- For redirection, the shell adjusts file descriptors in the child processes before invoking execve.
- For built-ins, the shell executes them directly in the parent process when it is safe to do so (for example, cd and exit).

Piping and I/O redirection in detail
- Piping
  - Each pipe creates a pair of file descriptors: read end and write end.
  - The first commandâ€™s stdout connects to the write end of the first pipe.
  - Each intermediate command connects its stdin to the previous pipeâ€™s read end and its stdout to the next pipeâ€™s write end.
  - The last command reads from the final pipeâ€™s read end and writes to the terminal or a redirection target.
- Redirection
  - Output redirection (>, >>) attaches the commandâ€™s stdout to a file descriptor pointing to a file.
  - Input redirection (<) attaches the commandâ€™s stdin to a file descriptor reading from a file.
  - The shell uses dup2 to swap the standard file descriptors with the file descriptor created for the redirection, then closes the original descriptors.
- Here-doc and advanced redirection
  - If supported, here-doc allows embedding a short input block directly in the command line, which is fed to the commandâ€™s stdin during execution.

Background processes and job control
- The shell supports running processes in the background using the & symbol.
- In the background mode, the shell does not wait for the child to finish; it continues accepting new commands.
- Job status and basic information are tracked to allow listing and basic management.
- Basic signals are used to prevent zombie processes. The shell waits for children only when needed and reaps them safely.

Signals and safety
- SIGINT (Ctrl-C) typically interrupts foreground processes.
- SIGCHLD is captured to detect when a child process exits or stops.
- The shell should avoid leaving orphaned resources and ensure file descriptors are properly closed.
- When a child process terminates, the shell updates its internal job state and prints a concise notification if appropriate.

Debugging, tracing, and testing
- The code base includes hooks for debugging and tracing execution flow.
- You can enable verbose logging for parsing, forking, and execution events while learning how a shell behaves internally.
- A small test suite validates the behavior of parsing, pipeline creation, and redirection handling.
- You can extend tests to cover edge cases you discover in your experiments.

Code structure and design decisions
- Modularity
  - The project is organized into modules with clear responsibilities. Parser, executor, and built-in command logic live in separate components with clean interfaces.
  - The separation makes it easier to introduce new features, such as additional built-ins or more advanced job control.
- Readability
  - The code emphasizes readability and straightforward flow. I/O, process management, and signal handling are implemented with direct, well-documented code.
  - Comments explain why a given approach was chosen, not just what the code does.
- Extensibility
  - The shell is designed to be extended. Adding a new built-in is a matter of implementing a handler and hooking it into the command dispatcher.
  - You can adapt the parsing logic to support new operators or more advanced syntax as you learn more about shell behavior.

Screenshots, diagrams, and visuals
- Terminal style imagery helps convey the shell environment. For a quick visual representation, you can include this simple shell diagram in your docs or classroom materials:
  - ![Unix shell icon](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Unix_shell_icon.svg)
- A schematic showing the flow from user input to process creation can be created using ASCII art or simple vector diagrams. The important thing is to illustrate the flow:
  - User input -> Parser -> Command graph -> Fork to create child processes -> Set up pipes and redirections -> Exec in children -> Foreground vs background -> Shell waits or returns to prompt
- You can also include a small dashboard-like image or a terminal screenshot demonstrating typical behavior (for example, a pipeline with three commands and a background job). When using images, ensure you respect licensing terms and provide attribution if required.

Usage tips and best practices
- Start with simple commands to verify the basic loop works: a single command with no redirection.
- Gradually add pipes to observe how data moves from one process to another.
- Introduce redirection one operator at a time to understand how file descriptors are re-routed.
- Try background tasks to learn how the shell handles concurrency and cleanup.
- Build small, repeatable test cases to verify each feature you modify or extend.
- Use built-in commands to manage the environment and neighborhood of commands, such as PWD and CD.
